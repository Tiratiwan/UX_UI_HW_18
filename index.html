                    <h2>User Research</h2>
                    <p>When I researched, I started with setting the goal and what we would like to know, then created questions. Finding interviewees who are our target audience and interview by using Zoom or Google Meet. I asked 'why' to get in-depth insight from users, and most of the time, I got surprised insights

                    <p>Asking 'why' and put yourself in your interviewees' shoes to get more insights and their emotions. After getting answers, I used the 'Miro' board to generate and categorize to see the overall information. After that, I made an Empathy map for a better understanding of the target user.

                    <h2>Qualitative Interviews</h2>
                    <p>I asked from general to narrow-down questions. Always make sure that the question won't lead interviewees to answer, and avoid Yes/No questions to get broader  information. I always approach them and let them with a relaxing and informal vibe. For instance, I set a Zoom meeting to interview. I talked with them and made them feel more comfortable before starting the interview session.
